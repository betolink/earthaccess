# Access to selected datasets

## Learning goals

These tutorials walk through **end-to-end workflows on specific NASA
datasets** — searching for the data, opening or streaming the files, and
analyzing them. They are dataset-centric rather than API-centric: each one
shows a real scientific use case from `search_data()` / `search_datasets()`
through to `open()` and analysis.

Use these to see `earthaccess` in action on real missions. For the underlying
API in detail, see the [Results Class](../results/index.md) tutorials or the
[API reference](../../api/index.md).

## Tutorials

- [Streaming data from EMIT](../../user/tutorials/emit-earthaccess.ipynb) —
  search, summarize, and stream granules from NASA's EMIT mission.
- [Analyzing sea level rise in the cloud](../../user/tutorials/SSL.ipynb) —
  a full workflow that searches, opens, and analyzes data end-to-end.
- [Accessing remote files with earthaccess](../../user/tutorials/file-access.ipynb) —
  open remote files with fsspec-backed sessions.

## Try it next

- [How data access works](../../user/explanation/access.md) — the two access
  methods: `download()` and `open()`.
- [Using authenticated sessions](../../user/howto/edl.ipynb) — HTTP / S3
  sessions used by the workflows above.
- [Results Class tutorials](../results/index.md) — what the lazy result
  containers can do.
